# Codeforces Simplifier ✨

**A Chrome Extension that makes Codeforces problems easier to understand using Gemini AI.**

---

## Why this project?

Many junior developers struggle not with solving Codeforces problems—but with understanding the problem statement itself. This extension is built to solve that exact pain.

No cheating. Just clarity.

---

## What does it do?

- Extracts the current Codeforces problem text.
- Sends it to Gemini AI.
- Returns a simplified, cleaner, easier-to-understand English version.

✅ Useful for those with:
- Language barriers  
- High pressure during contests  
- Cognitive overload while reading complex phrasing

---

## Core Philosophy

> Empower junior developers through **understanding**, not shortcuts.

This tool is made by and for developers who believe AI should **assist learning**, not replace it.

---

## Planned Features (Coming Soon)
- Smart Topic Detection:
  - Instantly detect the likely algorithmic topic of the problem (e.g. Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Prefix Sum…) to help you know what mindset to approach it with.

- Contextual Hints System:
  - Lightweight hints that nudge your thinking without spoiling the solution—ideal for learning and practicing under guidance.

- Native Language Support:
  - Human-style translations of the problem statement into Arabic (and potentially other languages), to remove language as a barrier to deep understanding.

- Focused Highlighting:
  - Automatically highlights the most critical parts of the problem (like constraints, tricky conditions, and goals), so you don’t miss the important details.

## Vision

This tool will be released as an **open-source Palestinian project**, and submitted to the Codeforces community.

We believe in:

**"Building from pain. Learning from chaos."**
